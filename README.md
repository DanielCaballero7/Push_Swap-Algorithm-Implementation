**Push_Swap: A Clever Sorting Algorithm**


## Overview

"Push_Swap" is an ingenious sorting algorithm project that I developed to showcase my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. This project highlights my ability to devise efficient sorting strategies and manage complex data structures.

## Description

"Push_Swap" is a sorting algorithm that takes an unsorted list of integers as input and arranges them in ascending order using a restricted set of operations. The algorithm operates on two stacks, A and B, and a set of predefined commands to manipulate the stacks.

The objective of "Push_Swap" is to find the optimal sequence of commands that would sort stack A. The allowed commands include swapping the top elements of stacks A and B (sa, sb), pushing an element from stack A to stack B (pa, pb), rotating the top element of a stack to the bottom (ra, rb), and reversing the rotation direction (rra, rrb).

The challenge lies in minimizing the number of operations required to sort the stack effectively. The project requires a deep understanding of data structures and algorithmic complexity to devise efficient sorting strategies.
